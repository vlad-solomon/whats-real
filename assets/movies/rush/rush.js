Meanwhile, the women in their lives can only watch as both drivers risk death with every lap."

  {
    "name": "Did James Hunt crash Niki Lauda out of the Formula 3 race?",
    "description": "According to the movie, Lauda and Hunt first came across each other in the Formula 3 race at Crystal Palace in 1970. But the fact is that Lauda did not attend the race while Hunt actually did not finish the race, after getting involved in a crash with another driver."
  },
  {
    "name": "Was Niki Lauda really as serious a driver as the movie depicts?",
    "description": "\"I was not as strict as I appeared in the movie,\" says the real Niki Lauda, \"but I was more disciplined than he [James Hunt] was. I would never drink before a race. Certainly after it; I had to. Every race could have been my last.\""
  },
  {
    "name": "Were Niki Lauda and James Hunt polar opposites?",
    "description": "In the movie, James Hunt is shown as a binge drinker, who liked to party before and after the race, whereas Niki Lauda is portrayed as a serious type who stayed away from drinking. In Lauda’s own words, while he did stay away from alcohol before the race, he had to have a drink after it. In fact, while Lauda is shown to pointedly avoid his rival’s garage at the circuit, in reality, they actually had quite a few drinks together after the race."
  },
  {
    "name": "Did Niki Lauda and James Hunt hate each other?",
    "description": "Rush portrays both rivals hating each other on the track as well as off it. While it is true that they shared an intense rivalry on the track, they did not take their rivalry beyond it, unlike what the movie suggests. In fact, for a short period of time, the rivals shared a flat as well!"
  },
  {
    "name": "Was James Hunt's McLaren really disqualified after a race for being too wide?",
    "description": "Yes. In Madrid, Spain on May 2, 1976, James Hunt took the win over Niki Lauda at the Spanish Grand Prix. In the scrutineering area shortly after the race concluded, James Hunt's car was disqualified after it was found to be 1.8 centimeters too wide. Hunt's points were given to Lauda. McLaren and Hunt appealed the decision, arguing that the difference had not affected the performance of the car, to which Lauda and Ferrari grossly disagreed."
  },
  {
    "name": "Why was Niki Lauda nicknamed \"The Rat\"?",
    "description": "The Rush movie true story reveals that Lauda was known as \"The Rat\" for his protruding teeth. Actor Daniel Brühl, who portrays Lauda in the film, had to have prosthetic teeth put in for the role. The real Niki Lauda talked about the origin of the nickname during an interview with the Telegraph, \"Marlboro was the sponsor. They put 'The Rat' on my visor,\" says Lauda. \"A marketing guy thought of it because of my teeth.\" James Hunt would at times use the nickname when speaking to Lauda."
  },
  {
    "name": "Did Niki Lauda really call a meeting of his fellow racers over his safety concerns regarding the race at Nürburgring?",
    "description": "Yes. As the safety spokesperson for the drivers, the real Niki Lauda called a meeting of his fellow racers in an attempt to have the race at Nürburgring stopped, but many of his fellow drivers didn't agree. In the end, he lost by one vote and was left with little choice but to race. It would be the last Formula One race ever run on that track at Nürburgring, but for Lauda, it was one race too many on a track that had already claimed more than fifty lives."
  },
  {
    "name": "Was Niki Lauda really horribly burnt in a fiery crash?",
    "description": "Yes. On August 1, 1976, while racing in the German Grand Prix on the Nürburgring track in Nürburg, Germany, Niki Lauda lost control of his Ferrari Formula One racecar, which crashed into a wall on a bend, burst into flames, and drifted into the middle of the track where it was hit by another car."
  },
  {
    "name": "Did Ferrari hire a replacement driver as Niki was rushed to hospital?",
    "description": "In Rush, Brühl's Lauda suggests that Ferrari replaced him with Carlos Reutemann even as he was being helicoptered to hospital. But was his team that ruthless? Perhaps not, but Ferrari definitely didn't linger over the decision. \"It was difficult to explain the choice to Niki\", says Luca di Montezemelo, \"but the interests of Ferrari, then and now, always came ahead of those of the drivers, whoever they may have been.\""
  },
  {
    "name": "Did James beat up a journalist because of his question addresed to Niki?",
    "description": "A journalist did ask Lauda if he thought his marriage would survive in light of his facial scarring at a 1976 press conference. However, Hunt's subsequent assault on the bolshy hack is creative licence on the part of the filmmakers, albeit an incident in keeping with his fiery reputation and high regard for Lauda."
  },
  {
    "name": "How long did it take for Niki Lauda to start racing again after his crash?",
    "description": "Niki Lauda returned to Formula One racing just six weeks after his near fatal August 1, 1976 crash, missing only two races. In his first race back, he finished fourth in the Italian Grand Prix on September 12, 1976. His rival James Hunt retired from the race after spinning out. Hunt was trying to catch up after he had been forced to start in the rear when officials discovered that the fuel in his car had a higher octane level than allowed."
  },
  {
    "name": "Did the real Niki Lauda quit the 1976 Japanese Grand Prix because of the rain?",
    "description": "Yes, but it wasn't just because he felt that the rain-soaked track was unsafe. To complicate things, Lauda's tear ducts had been damaged by fire during the horrific crash at the German Grand Prix earlier in the season. His healing injuries left him unable to blink and his eyes were watering excessively during the race. This complication from his injury, combined with the rain, caused him to retire himself from the Japanese Grand Prix after two laps, as he felt is was unsafe to continue. Lauda's decision to withdraw from the race hurt his previously amicable relationship with Ferrari."
  },
  {
    "name": "Was Niki Lauda disappointed that James Hunt won the 1976 championship as a result of the race in Japan?",
    "description": "No. \"I said at the same time at the time there, if anybody should get the championship, then I'm happy it's James,\" says Lauda, \"because I liked him, and we were not buddies but we were at least sympatico. We took care of each other from the heart in a very nice way, which in these days the heart was never shown in Formula One.\" \"I feel really sorry for Niki,\" the real James Hunt said shortly after the championship race in Japan. \"I feel sorry for everybody that the race had to be run in such ridiculous circumstances, and quite honestly, you know I wanted to win the championship, and I felt that I deserved to win the championship. I also felt that Niki deserved to win the championship, and I just wish we could have shared it.\""

trivia = [
  "In an interview with Austrian Times on the occasion of his 60th birthday, Niki Lauda stated that a journalist asking him how his injured face affected his marriage was the biggest insult he had to suffer in his life.",
  "Despite having to bend the truth in some areas, the film was warmly received by the most discerning critics, namely, the Formula One industry. When Rush was pre-release screened at the German Grand Prix in July (2013), the audience comprised a group of F1 drivers, team bosses, and British motor sports magnate Bernie Ecclestone. Director Ron Howard declared that the experience was his toughest 'reality' test since screening his Apollo 13 (1995) for NASA's astronauts and mission controllers in 1995. Nevertheless, Rush received a standing ovation.",
  "The real Niki Lauda claims the movie was entirely accurate. However, the film took creative liberties of the James Hunt and Lauda rivalry.",
  "Jochen Mass portrayed himself, driving the #12 Marlboro McLaren in the movie. Mass is seen passing stuntmen portraying Niki Lauda and James Hunt (Mass' teammate) in a key scene at the 1976 German Grand Prix, the site of the Nurburgring accident. A production assistant, assigned to work on the end-of-movie credit roll, was allegedly making the rounds on the set as the crew filmed at Nurburgring in fall 2012 and asked Mass what his name was. When he stated his name several times, the assistant protested, \"No, your real name. What is your real name?\" The assistant went off in search of someone who spoke German because she was sure the man did not understand her question.",
  "Daniel Brühl and Niki Lauda became good friends. Lauda even flew the actor to the Sao Paolo Grand Prix in his private jet which he piloted himself."
