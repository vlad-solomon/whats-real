    "name": "Did Katherine's father really move the family 120 miles each school year so that she and her siblings could continue their education?",
    "description": "Yes. Born in 1918, Katherine G. Johnson's impressive intellect was evident from the time she was a child. She was fascinated with numbers and became a high school freshman by age 10. In her hometown of White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia, school for African-Americans normally stopped at the eighth grade for those who could afford to attend. Katherine's father, Joshua, was determined to see his children reach their potential, so he drove the family 120 miles to Institute, West Virginia, where blacks could pursue an education past the eighth grade, through high school, and into college. He rented a house for the family to stay during the school year and journeyed back and forth to White Sulphur Springs for his job at a hotel. He did this for eight years, so that each of his four children could go to high school and college. Katherine proved to be so smart that she skipped several grades, graduating high school at age 14 and from West Virginia State College at 18."

    "name": "Did black women have to abide by segregation laws when they first started working at Langley in the 1940s?",
    "description": "Yes. \"At the time the black women came to work at Langley [in 1943], this was a time of segregation,\" says Hidden Figures author Margot Lee Shetterly. \"Even though they were just starting these brand new, very interesting jobs as professional mathematicians, they nonetheless had to abide by the state law, which was that there were segregated work rooms for them, there were segregated bathrooms, and there were segregated cafeterias. On their table in the cafeteria was a sign that said 'colored computers,' which sort of sounds like an iMac or something, right, today? But this referred to the black women who were doing this mathematical work.\" They were essentially human computers."
  },
  {
    "name": "Did they really think Katherine G. Johnson was the janitor there to empty the garbage can?",
    "description": "No. This does not appear in Margot Lee Shetterly's Hidden Figures book, on which the movie is based, and seems to be an element of fiction created by the filmmakers. It should be noted that the movie was actually based on just a 55-page proposal for the book, which might in part explain some of the movie's deviations. The book was released on September 9, 2016, long after production on the movie had wrapped. However, the filmmakers did have access to the author and her notes."
  },
  {
    "name": "Were the women really known as \"computers\"?",
    "description": "Yes. Before the days of electronic computers that we're familiar with today, the women hired at NASA to calculate trajectories, the results of wind tunnel tests, etc. had the job title of \"computer.\" In simple terms, these were mathematicians who performed computations. Even when electronic computers were first used at NASA, human computers like Katherine Johnson still often performed the calculations by hand to verify the results of their electronic counterparts."
  },
  {
    "name": "Did the women mathematicians at NASA get to meet astronauts like John Glenn?",
    "description": "Yes. \"We did get to meet the astronauts,\" says the real Katherine Johnson. \"They weren't as excited as we were, and we just looked at them in awe.\""
  },
  {
    "name": "Did Katherine have to run across the NASA Langley campus to use the bathroom?",
    "description": "Not exactly. In Margot Lee Shetterly's book, this is something that is experienced more by Mary Jackson (portrayed by Janelle Monáe) than Katherine Johnson. Mary went to work on a project on NASA Langley's East Side alongside several white computers. She was not familiar with those buildings and when she asked a group of white women where the bathroom was, they giggled at her and offered no help. The closest bathroom was for whites. Humiliated and angry, Mary set off on a time-consuming search for a colored bathroom. Unlike in the movie, there were colored bathrooms on the East Side but not in every building. The sprint across the campus in the movie might be somewhat of an exaggeration, but finding a bathroom was indeed a point of frustration. As for Katherine Johnson herself, Shetterly writes that when Katherine started working there, she didn't even realize that the bathrooms at Langley were segregated. This is because the bathrooms for white employees were unmarked and there weren't many colored bathrooms to be seen. It took a couple years before she was confronted with her mistake, but she simply ignored the comment and continued to use the white restrooms. No one brought it up again and she refused to enter the colored bathrooms."

  {
    "name": "Was Katherine really told that women aren't usually included in the space program briefings?",
    "description": "Yes. \"I asked permission to go,\" says Katherine, \"and they said, 'Well, the girls don't usually go,' and I said, 'Well, is there a law?' They said, 'No.' Then my boss said, 'Let her go.' And I began attending the briefings.\" In the Hidden Figures movie, Jim Parsons' character, Paul Stafford, tells Katherine (Taraji P. Henson) that women don't go to the briefings. \"There's no protocol for women attending,\" Stafford states. After she continues to question this unspoken rule, their boss, Al Harrison (Kevin Costner), decides to let her attend the briefing."
  },
  {
    "name": "Did Katherine Johnson really compute John Glenn's trajectory?",
    "description": "Yes. \"When John Glenn was to be the first astronaut to go up into the atmosphere and come back, and they wanted him to come back in a special place, and that was what I did, I computed his trajectory,\" says Katherine Johnson. \"From then on, any time they were going to compute trajectories, they were given mostly, all of them to my branch, and I did most of the work on those by hand.\""
  },
  {
    "name": "Did John Glenn really ask that Katherine double-check the electronic computer's calculations for his first Earth orbit?",
    "description": "Yes. Fact-checking the Hidden Figures movie confirmed that John Glenn personally requested that Katherine recheck the electronic computer's calculations for his February 1962 flight aboard the Mercury-Atlas 6 capsule Friendship 7 — the NASA mission that concluded with him becoming the first American to orbit the Earth. The scene in the movie unfolded in almost exactly the same way it does in real life, with Glenn's request for Katherine taken nearly verbatim from the transcripts. He even refers to her as \"the girl.\" \"Get the girl to check the numbers... If she says the numbers are good... I'm ready to go.\""
  },
  {
    "name": "Was Dorothy Vaughan NACA's first black supervisor?",
    "description": "Yes. As we explored the Hidden Figures true story, we discovered that Dorothy Vaughan became NACA's first black supervisor in 1948, five years before Katherine Johnson started working there. Vaughan was also an advocate and voice for the women in the \"West Computers\" pool. The movie shows her leading the women down the hall to their next assignment, an obvious nod to the team of astronauts walking down the hall in the 1983 movie The Right Stuff."
  },
  {
    "name": "Was Mary Jackson really NASA's first African-American female engineer?",
    "description": "Yes. Mary Jackson, portrayed by Janelle Monáe in the movie, was hired to work at Langley in 1951. Like in the movie, she accepted an assignment assisting senior aeronautical research engineer Kazimierz Czarnecki (renamed Karl Zielinski in the movie), who encouraged her to pursue a degree in engineering, which required her to take after-work graduate courses. She petitioned the city of Hampton to be able to attend graduate classes alongside her white peers. She won, got her degree, and was promoted to engineer in 1958."
  },
  {
    "name": "Is Kevin Costner's character based on a real person?",
    "description": "Not exactly. In researching the Hidden Figures true story, we learned that Kevin Costner's character, Al Harrison, is based on three different directors at NASA Langley during Katherine Johnson's time at the research facility. The movie's director, Theodore Melfi, was unable to secure the rights to the guy he wanted, so he decided to make Costner's Al Harrison a composite character."
  },
  {
    "name": "Is Jim Parsons' character, NASA engineer Paul Stafford, based on a real person?",
    "description": "No. In fact-checking the Hidden Figures movie, we learned that white collar statistician Paul Stafford, portrayed by Jim Parsons, is a fictional character. He was created to represent certain racist and sexist attitudes that existed during the 1950s. In the film, he thwarts every effort Katherine (Taraji P. Henson) makes to get ahead, including reducing her job qualifications to secretarial duty, omitting her byline on official reports, and telling her it's not appropriate for women to attend space program briefings. By the end of the movie, Stafford's fictional storyline includes the character having a change of heart, which is emphasized when he brings Katherine a cup of coffee."
  },
  {
    "name": "Is Kirsten Dunst's character, Vivian Mitchell, based on a real person?",
    "description": "No. Hard-nosed supervisor Vivian Mitchell (Kirsten Dunst) is a fictional character created to represent some of the unconscious bias and prejudice of the era. She is at best a composite of some of the supervisors who worked at NASA Langley."

trivia = [
  "When Taraji P. Henson signed on for the lead role, she met with the real-life Katherine Johnson, who was 98 years old, to discuss the character she was about to portray. Henson learned that Johnson had graduated from high school at age 14 and from college at age 18, and was still as lucid as anyone years younger. After the film was screened for Johnson, she expressed her genuine approval of Henson's portrayal, but wondered why anybody would want to make a film about her life.",
  "The actual working relationship between the engineers and women was not as hostile as it appears in the film. While there were clearly racial issues at play, the majority of the engineers were able to work with the computers with no issues.",
  "On the day that the scene was filmed in which Paul Stafford is speaking to the NASA engineers in the Space Task Group office about needing to develop the math for re-entry, there was an extra face in the crowd. Mark Armstrong, son of Apollo 11 astronaut Neil Armstrong, had been invited by actor Ken Strunk to make a cameo appearance in the scene, and joined the other actors who were playing the NASA engineers.",
  "Before presenting the award for Best Documentary Feature at The Oscars in 2017, the film's stars, Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monáe, introduced Henson's real life counterpart, 98 year old Katherine Johnson, to the stage, where she received a standing ovation from the audience.",
  "At age 98, Katherine Johnson was the only survivor of the 'Hidden Figures Trio' to see her achievements depicted on film. In November 2015, President Barack Obama awarded her a Presidential Medal of Freedom for her work at NASA, and she was further honored the following year when a new $30m, 40,000-square-foot NASA building was named the Katherine G Johnson Computational Research Facility."
